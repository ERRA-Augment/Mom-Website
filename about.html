        <h4><br>What I offer is upholstery sewing and embroidery services for large restaraunts, coffee shops, home furniture, antiques, marine upholstery and custom made cushions for windows, benches, recreational vehicles.<br><br> I began my sewing career
            at the age of 9. A hobby for a majority of my adolecent life which developed into a labor of love. Under the guidance of her father Tom Gauthier a world renowned woodworking artist of snooker cues. His attention to detail and expecting no
            less than perfection from his work with his utmost respect for his customers was instilled into my life as the true foundation of success. I went on to training in customer service and began developing my skills as a seamstress in a local
            upholstery shop.

            <br><br>Over the years I spent alot of time collecting equipment and machines needed to have a fully equipped upholstery studio, as well has developed working relationships with various upholsterers, wood workers and suppliers. I believe my
            work requires a level of workmanship and personability in order to have a satisfied customer.

            <br><br>By eliminating the high cost of a city store front enables me to extend fair prices to my customers without compromising on the workmanship and quality I offer to my customers. I welcome you to my lovely well equipped studio attached
            to my home nestled in beautiful Maple ridge.<br>
